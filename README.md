# JobLister Website

Basically, we had created an online website for Job listing where one can search, add or apply for the job.

We had created Registration page and separate pages for Login for users as well as admin. As users can only search the job or can apply for the job by uploading his resume; while admin can add or delete the job.

We had used HTML, CSS, PHP for the development of Job Listing Website.
